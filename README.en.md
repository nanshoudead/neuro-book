Everyone has a novel in them, and most of those novels die halfway — not from lack of talent, but from lack of engineering. NeuroBook wants to turn thirty years of software engineering practice and a century of creative writing methodology into one set of tools shared by you and your AI. Your work lives in local Markdown files — take it anywhere.

> [!NOTE]
> **This is the v2 preview (0.11).** NeuroBook is being rebuilt from scratch per [NeuroBook v2: side-by-side rebuild](docs/proposals/neuro-book-v2-rebuild.md): first a solid foundation — workbench, files and editors, settings and plugins — then AI writing, the World Engine and the plot workbench, one at a time (see the [roadmap](#roadmap)). Software and APIs will still change; feedback is welcome.

## Install and run

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.3.14 or newer (NeuroBook runs on Bun only).

```sh
bun add -g @notnotype/neuro-book
nbook
```

`nbook` starts the local server in the foreground and opens your browser; Ctrl-C stops it, and running it again opens the instance that is already running. The server listens on loopback only; on a remote machine, forward it with `ssh -L 4217:127.0.0.1:4217 <host>`. Data lives in your platform's data directory (`~/.local/share/neuro-book` on Linux), and books default to `NeuroBook` under your documents folder. Options, data locations and upgrades are described in the [app package notes](packages/neuro-book/scripts/app-package/README.md) (Chinese).

## What it does today

- **Bookshelf**: the home page when no book is open — stats, where you left off, and the mascot on your desk; create a book, open an existing folder, change covers and details.
- **Workbench**: activity bar, sidebars, editor area, panel and status bar; views can be dragged elsewhere and maximized, and the layout is remembered; command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) and quick open.
- **Files**: an explorer for plain, content and binder folders, with drag and drop, rename and batch operations; changes made outside the app show up immediately.
- **Editors**: a Markdown editor that reads and writes your book's dialect (Chinese typesetting rules, unknown syntax kept as is), plus a source editor, an image viewer and a sandboxed HTML preview; unsaved changes are guarded when switching or closing.
- **Settings**: a settings window organized by section, with separate user and book layers, or edit the settings file directly.
- **Plugins**: views, commands, menus, status bar items and settings sections are all open to plugins — the built-in features are plugins too. Install from the plugins page or with `nbook plugin install`; changes apply after a restart.

## Write a plugin

<img src="docs/images/readme/mood-write.webp" align="right" width="64" alt="" />

Plugins are written in TypeScript and Vue. The SDK package `@notnotype/nb-plugin-sdk` ships the author command `nbooke`; no global install needed:

```sh
bunx -p @notnotype/nb-plugin-sdk nbooke create my-plugin
cd my-plugin && bun install
bun run build
nbook plugin install dist
```

The generated plugin adds a view to the sidebar, a command to the palette and an entry to settings — change it and it's yours. Author docs, the available APIs and example plugins are in the [SDK author guide](packages/neuro-book/plugin-sdk/README.md) (Chinese). Plugins are fully trusted and can access all your books and local resources; install only from sources you trust.

## Roadmap

<img src="docs/images/readme/mood-idea.webp" align="right" width="64" alt="" />

AI can write a good paragraph, but not a good novel: lore lives in chat memory and drifts; the gun planted in chapter 3 still hasn't fired by chapter 200; the prose reads like AI; and drafts, lore and plot discussions are scattered across three tools. The previous version (0.10.x) tackled these as engineering problems; v2 is rebuilding them one by one on the new foundation. These are **not in v2 yet**:

- **AI writing studio**: a leader plans and dispatches, a writer drafts prose, a researcher looks things up; discuss, plan and execute modes, each switch needing your approval; inline edits in the editor.
- **World Engine**: event sourcing with timelines and snapshots — the state of any character, faction or kingdom at any moment is computed from earlier changes, and adding lore means inserting a snapshot.
- **Plot workbench**: a carrier tree for where the story is told and a causal tree for why it happens; foreshadowing tracked as promises from setup through payoff; creative decisions recorded on the spot.
- **llmlint**: lint your manuscript the way eslint lints code — 360 rules for filler words, mechanical transitions, formulaic parallelism and other AI tells. Available on its own today: [notnotype/llmlint](https://github.com/notnotype/llmlint).
- **Desktop app**: its own window and a bundled runtime, no Bun install needed.

Usable on its own today: the story graph `nbstory`, which turns a novel into a spoiler-free memory graph you can query by reading position, with a CLI, a web viewer, built-in Q&A and a Skill for Claude Code and Codex (`bun add -g @notnotype/nb-story`; see [nb-story](packages/nb-story/README.md)).
