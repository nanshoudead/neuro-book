# Simulation Directory

`simulation/` stores world runtime state and simulation artifacts. It is shared by writing mode and RP mode.

## Default Shape

```text
simulation/
|-- subjects/
|   `-- {subject-id}/
|       |-- subject.md
|       |-- soul.md
|       |-- events.jsonl
|       |-- memory.jsonl
|       |-- mind.md
|       `-- state.md
|-- entities/
|   `-- {entity-id}/
|       |-- entity.md
|       |-- events.md
|       `-- state.md
`-- runs/
    |-- current.md
    |-- index.md
    `-- ticks/
```

`roleplay/` is the old directory name. The current target directory is `simulation/`.

Old directory migration:

```text
roleplay/                 -> simulation/
roleplay/actors/{id}/     -> simulation/subjects/{id}/
roleplay/playthrough/     -> simulation/runs/
roleplay/gm.md            -> manual/gm-guide.md + agent-context/rp.leader/context.md for user-facing RP hosting
roleplay/gm.md            -> agent-context/simulator.leader/context.md for world simulation and adjudication rules
```

## Root Files

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `subjects/` | Information-control subjects, such as characters, the player, organizations or faction representatives. |
| `entities/` | Stateful instances, such as unique items, doors, mechanisms, event processes or locations with runtime state. |
| `runs/` | Tick logs, scratch notes, briefs and run artifacts. |

`actor` is a kind of simulator, not a top-level directory. Character-like simulators live under `simulation/subjects/`.

Profile-specific project guidance lives in `agent-context/`, not in `simulation/`. For example, `rp.leader` reads `agent-context/rp.leader/context.md`, and `simulator.leader` reads `agent-context/simulator.leader/context.md`. `rp.writer` does not bind its own context file at profile creation time; upstream coordinators must inject any relevant project guidance into each writer brief.

## Runtime Profiles

Current RP / simulation profile contract:

| Profile | Role | Reads | Writes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rp.leader` | RP host and user-facing coordinator. It manages quickstart, table contract, companion-mode conversation, player-safe explanation and handoff to simulation. It may call `simulator.leader` for world adjudication instead of silently rewriting runtime state. | `AGENTS.md`, `manual/README.md`, `manual/player-guide/`, `manual/gm-guide.md`, `agent-context/rp.leader/context.md`, `agent-context/rp.leader/memory.md`, and user-approved context. | RP-facing notes only when explicitly requested or approved. Runtime state changes should be handed to `simulator.leader` or written only after clear user authorization and simulation contract review. |
| `simulator.leader` | World simulator leader shared by writing mode and RP. It understands the task or user action, dispatches actor emulators, adjudicates the world, maintains state/entities, builds writer-safe brief and reports the result. | `AGENTS.md`, `agent-context/simulator.leader/context.md`, recent `simulation/runs/`, subject/entity state, Plot context and god-view lorebook / reference allowed by its context. | Approved subject `state.md`, `simulation/entities/`, necessary `simulation/runs/` and explicit simulation context changes. New subjects/entities should be reported before creation unless the current prompt explicitly grants automatic authority. |
| `simulator.actor` | Single-subject simulator. Its main run Imports `soul.md` (first-person roleplay handbook) as identity, and only uses actor-safe context injected by sidecar plus the current actor-facing packet. It never sees `subject.md` (god-view secret file). | Main run sees `soul.md`, actor binding metadata, `<actor-sidecar-context>` and the current actor-facing packet. `actor.context-load` sidecar is a pure RAG retriever: it reads no files and only runs subject RAG over `events.jsonl` / `memory.jsonl`. | Main run does not write files; `actor.memory-save` sidecar appends `events.jsonl`, curates `memory.jsonl`, and updates `mind.md`. It reads/writes neither `subject.md`, `soul.md` nor `state.md`. |
| `rp.writer` | Tick prose renderer. It turns an upstream writer brief into user-visible prose through a multi-step pass: draft, stop-slop self-review, then write and polish. It keeps the small-cat writer preset and RP storytelling tone. | Profile initial is empty. It only consumes the current writer brief and reads extra paths when the brief explicitly asks it to. | Writes the final prose to the output path given in the writer brief (typically `simulation/runs/ticks/{id}-{slug}/prose.md`). Falls back to assistant-text prose only when the brief omits an output path. |

`simulator.leader` must not hand complete `simulation/`, `lorebook/` or `reference/` to actor / writer. It filters god-view context into actor-facing messages or writer briefs.

`rp.leader` is the only canonical name for the RP host layer. Do not introduce `rp.gm` or revive `leader.rp` as a new contract name. Historical mentions of `leader.rp` refer to an older implementation.

`simulator.leader` remains the simulation runtime owner. It is not a companion host profile, and `rp.leader` is not a replacement for world simulation adjudication.

## Subject To Actor Input

`simulator.actor` input is intentionally narrow:

```ts
type SubjectSimulatorInput = {
    subjectPath: string;
    kind: "player" | "npc";
};
```

`subjectPath` points to the subject directory in Agent cwd-relative project form, such as `{project}/simulation/subjects/erina`. `kind` comes from the subject's `subject.md` frontmatter and selects the actor behavior rules (player avatar vs free-acting npc). The profile derives `subject.md`, `soul.md`, `events.jsonl`, `memory.jsonl`, `mind.md` and `state.md` from that directory; `soul.md` is Imported into the actor main run, while the rest are used for sidecar prompts. Callers should not pass separate file paths.

## Subjects

`simulation/subjects/{subject-id}/` stores entities that can know, misunderstand, judge, act and hide information. The player character should also be a subject.

详细文件职责与分流规则见 [subjects.md](subjects.md)。

```text
simulation/subjects/{subject-id}/
|-- subject.md
|-- soul.md
|-- events.jsonl
|-- memory.jsonl
|-- mind.md
`-- state.md
```

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `subject.md` | God-view secret file. Only `simulator.leader` may read it. Holds hidden truths, author intent and dispatch hints. Never injected into the actor. |
| `soul.md` | First-person roleplay handbook (no frontmatter). Imported directly into the actor main run as the character's identity. Contains only what the character knows about itself; no secrets. |
| `events.jsonl` | Append-only episodic memory. Each line is `{ tick?, time?, text }` and records what the subject experienced, observed, was told, thought, misunderstood or inferred at that time. |
| `memory.jsonl` | Editable stable memory. Each line is `{ topic, aliases?, view }` and records the subject's current view or understanding of a person, place, object, concept, organization or self-related stable constraint. |
| `mind.md` | Current short-term psychology, doubts, judgement, motivation and emotions. |
| `state.md` | Current location, visible condition, inventory summary, relationship pressure and short-term goals. |

## Subject RAG Memory

`events.jsonl` and `memory.jsonl` are the only subject files indexed by the first Subject RAG implementation. `subject.md` and `soul.md` are never indexed: `subject.md` holds god-view secrets and `soul.md` is already Imported into the actor main run. `subject_rag_search` treats `{project}/.nbook/subject-rag.sqlite` as a rebuildable SQLite + sqlite-vec cache; the JSONL files remain the source of truth.

The index is scoped by `subject_path` and `source_type`, so an actor can only recall the current subject's own episodic memories and stable views. It does not search lorebook, Project-wide files or other subjects.

`actor.context-load` is a pure RAG retriever: it reads no files, uses `subject_rag_search` for coarse recall, reranks and compresses candidates, then persists a small `<actor-sidecar-context>` into the actor session. `actor.memory-save` appends `events.jsonl` through `subject_event_append` and curates `memory.jsonl` through `subject_memory_update`, and does not touch `subject.md`, `soul.md` or `state.md`.

Embedding configuration is separate from Pi chat / vision model settings. Global Config owns the OpenAI-compatible embedding service; Project Config may only override embedding model and dimensions.

See [subject-rag-memory.md](subject-rag-memory.md) for the stable tool, index and configuration contract.

## Entities

`simulation/entities/{entity-id}/` stores stateful instances. Instantiation is for state tracking, not information control.

```text
simulation/entities/{entity-id}/
|-- entity.md
|-- events.md
`-- state.md
```

Create an entity when the object has:

- Independent state.
- Hidden truth.
- Unique or near-unique identity.
- Holder-specific differences.
- Damage, activation, progress, location or timer state.
- Major plot importance.

Do not instantiate every ordinary item. Three generic blood potions in an inventory can be an inventory count. A poisoned blood potion should become an entity.

## Runs

`simulation/runs/` stores tick artifacts for world simulation, RP, writing emulation or debugging. It is process record, not canon lorebook and not subject memory.

Recommended compact shape:

```text
simulation/runs/
|-- current.md
|-- index.md
`-- ticks/
    `-- 000001-short-slug/
        |-- report.md
        `-- prose.md
```

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `current.md` | Current world time, active scene, active conflicts, recent tick summary and pending next steps. |
| `index.md` | Tick index table: id, title, mode, world time, status and summary. |
| `ticks/{id}-{slug}/report.md` | Background report: trigger, scope, causal chain, adjudicated events, information boundary, state commits, writer-safe brief, open questions and next hooks. |
| `ticks/{id}-{slug}/prose.md` | User-visible prose for an RP tick, writing sample or rendered scene. Formal chapter prose still lives in `manuscript/.../index.md`. |

Rules:

- `runs/` is not named `sessions/`, to avoid confusion with Agent Session.
- Tick directory names should use `000001-short-slug`.
- Subjects do not read full `runs/` by default.
- Results that need to persist should be curated into `simulation/subjects/`, `simulation/entities/`, Plot System or `lorebook/`.
- `report.md` writer brief must contain only writer-safe information.
- `prose.md` stores user-visible prose, not background adjudication.

## Classification Method

For a new concept, classify in this order:

1. Is it stable canon, subject-facing knowledge, entity runtime state, plot plan, run process artifact or raw external material?
2. Stable canon goes to the most fitting `lorebook/` type.
3. Subject-facing knowledge goes to `simulation/subjects/{id}/`. Split by visibility: what the character knows about itself goes to `soul.md`; hidden truths and author intent go to the god-view `subject.md`. See [subjects.md](subjects.md) for file architecture and [../agent/rp-tick/subject-creation-guide.md](../agent/rp-tick/subject-creation-guide.md) for creation flow.
4. Stateful instances go to `simulation/entities/{id}/`.
5. Runtime process goes to `simulation/runs/`.
6. Plot planning goes to Plot System.
7. Raw external material goes to Project Workspace `reference/`.
